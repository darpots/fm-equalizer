# Frontend Mentor - Equalizer landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Equalizer landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/equalizer-landing-page-7VJ4gp3DE). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Made a mountain out of a molehill. Plenty of code I would rip out and do again differently. It may work and look representative but I am far from pleased with the code itself.

### Continued development

Need to spend more time planning and thinking in boxes. If I did that earlier I would have seen far easier ways to solve certain problems which would have been easier to code. Lesson learned.
